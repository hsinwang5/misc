		pixel, that grows based on a set of limited resource inputs.
	</h3>

	<ol>

	<h3>create a teacher assignment tracker/grading calculator 
		that makes it easier for teachers to keep track of student's 
		grades - would be a good idea to interview teachers to come 
		up with the biggest challenges in current systems
	</h3>

	<h3>Word education website - uses principle of "repeated exposure" up to 
		18 times at random intervals in different ways to help someone retain 
		a vertain vocabulary word or small piece of information. Uses a combo 
		of browser notices, logins for activities, and mobile notices to 
		reinforce chosen words over a certain time period. 
	</h3>

	<h3>Feed a cute anime waifu a bunch of different foods/drinks and watch
		her reveal details about her life/story. Eventually unlock things like 
		exotic foods and alcohol which causes her to open up even more. The 
		game doesn't have to mimic reality - you can feed her more than 
		what is reasonably possible in real life.
	</h3>

	<h3>Enterprise app that allows users to create forms for data collection
		from users, and an accounts page that allows them to view the 
		associated user-entered data. Basically a form creator. 
	</h3>
